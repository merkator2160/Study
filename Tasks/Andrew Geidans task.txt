Hi Evgeniy,

Thank you for applying to the job.

We are willing to give you a test task (paid) to understand your skills level.

What needs to be done:

A printer agent application (.NET Core Console App) that will receive a PDF file and send it to a label printer.

The process:
- The application runs as a scheduled task on a continuous basis on a PC (using WebJobs 3.0 library)
- A WebJob function within application listens for a message from an Azure Service Bus
- Once message is received, it uses file name in the message content and downloads file with that name from predefined Azure Storage Container
- Once file is downloaded, it sends it to a label printer
- Printed file moved to another container (archive)

Deliverables:
- .NET Core Console App itself
- Yaml script to build and publish the app artefacts using Azure DevOps build pipeline
- Powershell Azure CLI script that will be executed as part of a release pipeline, that will prepare necessary resources:
-- Service Bus
-- Service Bus queue namespace
-- Storage Account and creates container if it does not exists already for the label files
-- Storage Account for WebJobs logs and locks (i.e. WebJobs dashboard)
- Second Powershell Azure CLI script that will run on a target computer:
-- collect connection string to Azure Service Bus
-- collect connection string to WebJobs dashboard Storage Account
-- creates SAS token to access containers where PDF files are stored
-- configures necessary parameters on the web job appsettings file
-- deploys console app to a PC with DevOps agent installed on it and ensures scheduled task is created and starts it.

We will also share a template to base .NET Core Console App with WebJob on.

Can you please provide a high-level estimate on how long you think this may take you (both, effort and completion date)?

Kind regards,
Andrew
